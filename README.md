This file is related with the piece of work :
  
  "The Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon in the approximation of |x| by using Lagrange interpolation on the Chebyshev-Lobatto nodal systems."

It contains two Mathematic sets of commands (used to produce some of the graphics) and different figures in pdf format.

The material can be used and reproduced without limitation.
